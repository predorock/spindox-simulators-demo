# Spindox Simulators

Creation Steps:

```
ng new spindox-simulators --create-application=false
```
This command creates an angular project folder without a default application.
We will create application and libs manually:

## Applications

```
ng g application kitty-simulator
```

```
ng g application dummy-simulator
```

```
ng g application pizza-simulator
```
